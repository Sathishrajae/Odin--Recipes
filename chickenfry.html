            <ol>
                <li>Clean the chicken pieces and place in a bowl</li>
                <li>Add all the spices, ginger garlic paste, salt, and lime juice to this</li>
                <li>Mix well until the chicken pieces are well coated. You can also mix the marinade ingredients first in the bowl and then add the chicken pieces and mix together to coat</li>
                <li>Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. Leave for a minimum of 30 minutes if you are short on time
                </li>
                <li>Heat oil for deep frying and gently add the chicken pieces to it without overcrowding them</li>
                <li>Fry on medium-heat heat stirring occasionally until the chicken pieces are golden brown
                </li>
                <li>Take out one piece and test to see if the pieces are fully cooked</li>
                <li>When done, drain and place on kitchen towels for the excess oil to get absorbed</li>
                <li>Proceed with the remaining pieces until all done</li>
                <li>Serve hot with rice, any curry, and a simple salad. Itâ€™s best to consume chicken fry on the same day you prepare them</li>
